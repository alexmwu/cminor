These are some complete CMinor programs that you could use
as a starting point to test your compiler.  Note that they do
not provide complete test coverage, you still need to write
your own tests!

To try them out, add your cminor compiler to your `PATH`,
and then type `make`.

* bounce.cminor draws a bouncing box on the screen, using the X11 gfx library.
* fibonnacci.cminor computes tables of the Fibonnacci numbers.
* maze.cminor prints out a random maze using ascii characters.
